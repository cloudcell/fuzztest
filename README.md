# fuzztest

**The purpose of the package:** To isolate errors through identifying groups of parameter combinations that cause them.

**What this package does:** Tests all possible combinations of argument values for any function 
to produce test statistics and graphs.

Below is a demo test graph showing parameter setting (as _cardinal_numbers_) leading to function
failures (in color) and _cardinal_numbers_ of values leading to passing tests (in grey).
