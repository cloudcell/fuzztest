# fuzztest

**The purpose of the package:** To isolate errors through identifying groups of parameter combinations that cause them.

**What this package does:** Tests all possible combinations of argument values for any function 
to produce test statistics and graphs.

Below are a couple of demo test graphs showing parameter setting leading to function
failures. Axes are used only to group tests by _cardinal_numbers_ of argument parameters.
